# Third-party notices

Plenix ships the third-party software below, either copied into `platform/vendor/` and `platform/fonts/` or bundled into its built files (`platform/dist/platform.js`, the CDN's `plenix.js` and `plenix.esm.js`, and `@plenix-ds/react`). Each one keeps its own license. This file gathers them (issue 724).

- The versions copied into `platform/vendor/` are recorded in `platform/vendor/package.json`. CI compares them with the latest releases as information only (`npm outdated --prefix platform/vendor`).
- Each folder's README holds the files, checksums and update steps.
