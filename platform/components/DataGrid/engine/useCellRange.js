/* Plenix · DataGrid engine · cell range selection
   Summary: The block of cells a person selects with Shift and the arrow keys (issue 465, owner, 2026-11-01: an option, off by default):
     the range itself (an anchor cell and the cell that has focus, each a row and a column), the rectangle it covers in the order the
     grid shows rows and columns, what Ctrl or Command with C copies (the block as tab-separated text that Excel and Google Sheets paste as
     rows and columns), and what a screen reader hears (how many cells are selected, how many were copied).
   Usage:
     import { useCellRange } from './engine/useCellRange.js';
     const cellRange = useCellRange({ enabled: !!props.cellSelection && !isStatic, model, ordered, index, onChange: props.onCellSelectionChange });
     cellRange.rect                      // { r0, r1, c0, c1 } in model and column order, or null (no range, or one cell)
     cellRange.cellClasses(rowIndex, columnIndex)   // { inside, top, bottom, start, end } for one cell
     cellRange.extend({ row, c, key, rtl, focusCell })   // Shift + an arrow, Home or End on a cell
     cellRange.collapse(); cellRange.copy(); cellRange.read()
   Props:
     enabled: the grid's cellSelection option; false makes every method do nothing and the grid behave as it did before.
     model: the rows the grid shows (group rows included; they have no record and no cells); ordered: the visible columns, in order;
     index: the records' key field; onChange(details): the grid's onCellSelectionChange ({ from, to, cellCount, rowCount, columnCount, fields }, or null when the block ends).
   Behavior:
     The range is kept as keys (a row's id and a column's id), so it survives scrolling and virtualization; the copy reads the grid's data, not
     the page, so a block of any size copies at once. One cell is not a range: with the anchor and the focus on the same cell there is no
     rectangle. Shift with an arrow moves the focus end one cell (the focus cell scrolls into view and keeps keyboard focus); Shift with Home
     or End goes to the first or last column of the row; when focus is on a cell the block never reached (moved there by script), Shift
     with an arrow starts a new block from that cell; Escape, a plain arrow or a mouse press on a cell collapses the block to the active cell. In right to
     left the arrows are mirrored, and so are the block's start and end edges (they are logical).
     The count is announced politely once the arrow keys pause (400 ms), never once per key press while Shift and an arrow repeat.
   Notes:
     The rules of moving the block, the copy's text, the counts and the announcements are in cellRangeOps.js, loaded with one dynamic import the first
       time a block is extended (the npm package splits it into a chunk, so a grid without the option does not carry it; the iife builds inline it).
     Moved to its own file with the other concerns of the engine (issue 714); the rule that nothing changes for a grid without the option is
     proved by the engine's differential probe, run with the option off.
