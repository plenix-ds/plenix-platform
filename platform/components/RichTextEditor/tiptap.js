/* Plenix · RichTextEditor engine (tiptap.js)
   Summary: Asks the page's engines script for the engine every RichTextEditor runs on: Tiptap 3.31.3 (MIT, on ProseMirror),
     vendored as one file in platform/vendor/tiptap/tiptap.min.js that sets window.PlenixTiptap.
   Usage:
     loadTiptap().then((T) => new T.Editor({ element: { mount: el }, extensions: [T.StarterKit] }));
   Props:
     loadTiptap(win): resolves with the given window's PlenixTiptap (default this one: an editor in a frame runs on its
       frame's engine), loading it through PlenixEngines.tiptap on first use
   Behavior:
     Only the first editor on a page loads the file; later editors reuse the same promise. Pages without an editor never
       load it (no prefetch): RichTextEditor.preload() starts the load early on a page whose first screen has an editor.
     The page loads platform/engines/plenix-engines.js, which holds the vendor folder's address and the loader
       (issues 456, 457). Without it, loadTiptap rejects with a message that says the engines script is missing.
     The engine has no stylesheet of its own: the few rules ProseMirror needs are in rich-text-editor.css, on tokens.
   Notes:
     A failed load rejects and is forgotten, so the next editor that mounts tries again.
     The bundle holds @tiptap/core, @tiptap/pm, @tiptap/starter-kit (with its link, underline and list extensions),
       @tiptap/extension-list, -mention, -table, -text-style, -text-align, -highlight, -subscript, -superscript, -image and
       -typography, and their dependencies (platform/vendor/README.md: versions, licenses, how it is built). */
