# Changelog

All notable changes to Plenix: the packages (`@plenix-ds/tokens`, `icons`, `styles`, `react`), the CDN and the API.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow `VERSIONING.md`.
The batch numbers point to the work log (Plenix - DAM/audit/batches/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- `strings` props on 14 components for their words and announcements (CodeBlock, Count `moreThan`, Button, Card,
  WidgetGrid, BulkActions, NotificationList, MediaViewer, SearchWorkspace, NavList, FilterBar, AppShell, SecondaryPane,
  Pagination); `locale` where numbers are formatted (they follow the page language). English output is unchanged.
- Chat.Thread `follow`: opens at the newest message and keeps it in view as messages arrive.
- tests/keyboard.test.js (in `npm test` and CI) and tests/compare.js (before/after pixel comparison of two copies).

### Fixed
- Keyboard: Toolbar and ToolRail are one Tab stop (roving focus); Rating moves focus to the chosen star; the application
  switcher closes when focus leaves it; focus rings on Panel and SectionHeading toggles, DropZone, Rating and Pagination;
  the chat thread is reachable by keyboard. (batch 213)
- Screen readers: CodeBlock announces Copied or Could not copy; a capped Count says "More than 99"; a selected Card is
  aria-current. (batch 213)
- Right to left: arrow keys follow reading order (Toolbar, Tabs, SegmentedControl, Rating, Tree, MediaViewer, WidgetGrid,
  splitters); ButtonGroup joins, the Switch knob, the toast and the indeterminate progress mirror; directional icons
  (chevrons, arrows, panel open and close, undo and redo) mirror. (batch 214)
- Thumbnail and Avatar fall back to the icon or initials when their image fails to load. (batch 215)
- Font sizes are rem (the same at the default 16px), so text follows the person's font-size setting (WCAG 1.4.4). (batch 215)
- Object / record page: the aside stacks under the body below 1024px. (batch 215)
- Accessibility (axe-core, WCAG 2.2 AA): 418 issues to 3 on 140 pages. The calendar month is a labeled group of day
  buttons named by full date (no broken grid roles); WidgetGrid's live region sits beside its list; a Table (and a
  design system table) that scrolls is a named region in the Tab order, with the focus ring; design system state
  samples set ARIA states only where the role allows them. (batches 211, 212)

### Changed (visual)
- The drawer slides in from its edge (motion tokens; none with reduced motion). A Preview button shows a hover fill.
- SearchWorkspace's result count uses the item noun ("8 assets", not "8 results").
- Sentence case: "Add event", "Add task", "Save as", "Zoom in", "Zoom out". (batch 215)
- Link text (`--plx-sys-content-link`, light theme) is blue-600 instead of blue-400: 6.04:1 on the canvas (was 4.46).
  Primary buttons and the header keep blue-400. (batch 212)
- Subtle text (`--plx-sys-content-subtle`, light theme) is gray-700 instead of gray-600, as `content-muted`. (batch 212)
- The app name in the header is full white at 11px (was 70% white at 10px); the time on your own chat messages is full
  white. (batch 212)
- Suite data: tinted avatars use the tone's darker shade for initials (blue-700, brown-800). (batch 212)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- TypeScript definitions for `@plenix-ds/react` (`index.d.ts`), generated from each component's header comment: prop
  unions (`variant`, `size`, `tone`…), booleans, handlers and React nodes, with the header text and defaults as docs.
- API: `/api/v1/components` items carry their written sections (`purpose`, `anatomy`, `behavior`, `a11y`, `content`)
  and `sec`, `plenix`, `src`. The tokens endpoint lists the new Button tokens (630 tokens).
- `VERSIONING.md` (what is public, what each version part means) and this changelog; release notes come from it.
- Checks on every push: build, system and spec checks, release build, the Button visual snapshot, every page, and an
  accessibility scan (axe-core) whose known issues may only go down.
- 115 Button component tokens (`--plx-comp-button-*`): per size, per variant and state, focus ring, shape and type. Every
  Button value is now a token; the design system's Edit dialog edits one token per field. (batch 207)
- Design system: purpose, anatomy, behavior, accessibility and content guidance for all 125 built items; template
  references (which apps use each item); related items for the foundations. (batch 208)

### Changed
- `button.css` uses only Button tokens; each size sets all of its own values. No visual change: 218,118 computed values
  compared, 0 differences. (batch 207)
- Design system: "Use in code" names the packages (`@plenix-ds/react`, `@plenix-ds/styles`). (batch 208)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- The first release: `@plenix-ds/tokens` (515 tokens), `@plenix-ds/icons` (104 icons), `@plenix-ds/styles`
  (`plenix.css`, fonts, theme boot) and `@plenix-ds/react` (112 exports) on GitHub Packages.
- The CDN at https://design-system.lighthouseway.org/cdn/0.1.0/ and the JSON API at /api/v1/ (tokens, components,
  exports, taxonomy, guidance, icons). (batch 206)
