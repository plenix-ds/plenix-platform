      "LocaleProvider — the region's locale, catalogs, fallback, time zone, direction and digits (required)",
      "Catalog — messages by locale, flat dot keys or nested sections; plural messages are objects of Intl plural categories with optional exact counts (\"=0\") (required)",
      "Built-in words — i18n/en.js holds every word a Platform component shows or announces, one section per component; i18n/ar.js is the same sections in Arabic (required)",

A message is looked up in the exact locale, its language, the fallback locale, then English; for each, the application's catalog comes before Plenix's built-in words. A missing message returns its key. Catalog values are plain text: {name} placeholders are filled as text and no HTML is parsed.",

The built-in Arabic is the owner-approved wording of the Arabic chain: whole sentences per count with the Arabic number forms (\"حذف عنصرين؟\", not \"حذف 2 عناصر؟\"), never a count joined to a word. With digits \"auto\" an Arabic locale writes Arabic-Indic digits; emails and web addresses keep Latin digits."
