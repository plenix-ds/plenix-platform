You are a lane writer for the Plenix design-system library program: WAVE {W}, LANE {L}. Build every leaf of your lane for real (no placeholders), following the briefs, then report. You work in your own git worktree of the repo (your current working directory). Another writer works in parallel on disjoint files.

## Setup (in your worktree root)
1. `git submodule update --init platform/design-system`
2. Git Bash: `cmd //c mklink /J node_modules "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Plenix\node_modules"` (never delete through that junction).
3. Read, in order: tools/agent/library/BRIEF-lane.md (your contract), tools/agent/web/BRIEF-web.md (house rules), tools/agent/library/plan.md ("Recipe per kind" and "Wave {W}"), and your leaves in tools/agent/library/plan.json (`leaves[]`/`targets[]` with wave {W}, lane "{L}").
4. Look at finished examples: platform/design-system/parts/w07A.*, w07B.*, w07C.* (newest), their exports, tokens (platform/tokens/components/*.tokens.json) and web-native-map.d/w07*.json. Chart code lives in platform/charts/ (scales.js, ChartFrame.jsx; stylesheet platform/system/charts.css); build-exports.js publishes platform/charts/.

## Your lane
{TARGETS}
Your part files are w{WW}{L}. Ports: LABS_PORT={LP}; every other test/serve port in {PR} only (set TEST_PORT, NAV_PORT, TARGETS_PORT, TYPO_PORT explicitly).

Before building a leaf, check it is not already answered: grep platform/design-system/parts/*.records.js and inventory.js for `leaf: '<name>'` and in `covers` (w00A holds 49 covered-elsewhere leaves: skip them; w07K holds the command bar: CommandBar, FilterPanel, SortPanel, GroupPanel, ColumnsMenu, ViewMenu, QuickFilter with the Filter panel, Sort control, Grouping, Reordering, Quick filters leaves). Reuse existing code; never create a second record for a leaf. Do NOT edit CommandBar, BulkActions or the find panels (they are being changed right now); if a target needs them, compose them as they are or report it.

## Owner rules (strict)
- No new colors, themes, accents or any visible design choice the owner has not approved: use existing plx-sys roles (charts: the data-viz scales); otherwise build with existing roles and list it under "needs the owner".
- No inline styles anywhere (no style attribute, not even custom properties; SVG geometry attributes are fine, colors via classes); every value a token; 4px grid; logical properties; never 1px/2px nudges.
- Focused/invalid fields change only the border color. Reddit Mono for code and technical values (numbers, dates, axis ticks); DM Sans for UI text. American English, sentence case.
- Statuses are Badges (six variants; `icon` prop for the status icon) — never a dot as a label. Pills: soft 100/300/dark text, 4px radius.
- Links are not buttons and buttons are not links. Containers nest 2 deep max. A dynamic table (sort, filter, group, search) is the DataGrid; a static table is the Table, which looks the same; never a hand-built table. Menus 8px radius. Icons from platform/icons/map.json only.
- Scrolling regions keyboard reachable (tabIndex 0 + name) or useVirtualizer. Popups: prefer Popover/useFloating.
- Mobile widths follow the HIG / Material 3 when they conflict with web values.
- Never kill processes you did not start. Temporary scripts go in YOUR OWN session scratchpad.

## Checks (all must pass in your worktree before you report)
node --check on every .js you wrote; node build-app.js; node check-system.js → SYSTEM_OK; node check-spec.js → SPEC_OK; LABS_ONLY=<your lab ids> LABS_PORT={LP} node tests/labs.test.js; with CHANGED_BASE=HEAD and your ports: tests/typography.test.js, tests/a11y.test.js, and tests/pages.test.js once at the end; node tools/agent/native/check.js on your native fragments → ALL OK; look at each new page (light and dark) with a small puppeteer script (tests/lib.js serve/launch, your own port).

## Do not
Commit, push, release or deploy. Edit the main checkout (C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Plenix). Edit the shared files listed in BRIEF-lane.md "Never edit".

## Report (short)
Worktree path; files created/modified, split into (a) main repo and (b) platform/design-system (git status --porcelain in both); per target: record ids, lab ids with checks/tokens, variant pages, native map and fragments, test results; anything left undone with the reason; "needs the owner".
